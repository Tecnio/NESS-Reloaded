/**
 * Called when NESS executes a command as specified in the configuration.
 * 
 * [deprecated] This event is inherently unstable. When it fires is dependent on
 * arbitrary configuration values; it may be disabled entirely. Which
 * replacement should be used depends on the use case: If code listening to this
 * event intends to perform a callback or trigger after a player is flagged for
 * a violation, {@link NESSApi#addInfractionTrigger(InfractionTrigger)} is the
 * recommended way to do that. If it is intended to prevent a player from being
 * punished in certain conditions by cancelling this event,
 * {@link PlayerFlagEvent} should be used.
